3 VII: Last time, I also changed the zip function in fetch_remote
* hardcoded filenames into zip function
* changed DL function for easier testing

> This is all very ugly. Revert these changes, figure out the forking and make everything look nice and documented.

28 VI: DLing RX Norm - it's a zip file, so we can't stream. So far, I got it to DL and write the zip file, so the rest should be easier. However, I took the following short cuts that could later on blow up in my face:

* knocked out SSL downloading because NIH server did not like it
* knocked out Forking in fetch_input.py's zip method, because I don't 100% understand what it does: It's probably related to having multiple files; so if we want to make use of RX Norms full potential, I might just as well end up needing it.

The way how we write the zip file is not very elegant, it would be better to use sockets and write the file chunk by chunk.

Setup:
* change scratch path in settings and run make
* venv and install lxml
* To run: PYTHONPATH=.. python update/fetch_remote.py rxnorm
